      During my time as the Manager of a Network Development Team at Spectrum, I
      worked together with a management team to transition a team of twenty
      Network Engineers into Network Developers. This included guiding many into
      unclear territory as their job functions were transitioned. Discovering a
      clear career path and building a collaborative culture were some of the
      small difficulties to overcome. Once our Service Reliability Engineering
      team was estabilished, I guided them to continue development of scalable
      Ansible Playbooks for Automated Deployments in our Production Environment;
      Building automated regression tests using GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins; and
      Containerizing legacy applications in Docker.

      Mark is fantastic to work with. He's constantly working on growing his
      skillset and looking for ways to make work more efficient. His dedication to
      his job and learning new skills on and off the job is inspirational and
      admirable. I would highly recommend Mark for any engineering or leadership
      position.

      It is my honor to recommend Mark Reyes for a leadership position here at
      Charter Communications. Mark and I have known each other since 2015 and have
      worked together directly since early 2018. I have greatly enjoyed out time
      together and have come to esteem him as a technical authority, but more
      importantly a mentor. Serving as team lead, he was responsible for
      organizing the efforts of our team, cultivating new skills in myself and my
      teammates, conducting internal and cross-group conferences and seeing
      ambitious goals through to completion. I would be sad to see him go, but
      understand fully that his many organizational and leadership skills would
      serve the company far better from a position of management. Without a doubt,
      I can recommend Mark for a position of more senior leadership. Please feel
      free to contact me at byron.moore@charter.com if you wish to discuss Mark's
      qualifications and experience further - I would be happy to expand on my
      recommendation.

      I'm very appreciative for an opportunity to recommend Mark Reyes for a
      Network-Automation/DevOps manager position.  Being assigned for the past
      year to a group with Mark in a technical lead role, I’ve been more than
      impressed with his expertise in network development, willingness to share
      information, and his contributions towards a positive team environment.
      My current job as a Network Developer is new and challenging.  Mark has been
      tremendous in helping me to better understand software-defined networking
      and how our team goes about deploying solutions onto our network
      infrastructure.  My role within the group is to assist with the automation
      efforts of our solution workflow and Mark was immense in guiding me through
      this project.  His help included conducting code reviews, defining a source
      control strategy of code deployment among various environments involving
      Git, creating effective templates of Jenkins jobs that I could model to
      automate deployment, and enabling Webex notifications on the status of these
      jobs.
      In working with Mark, what I noticed right away was his ability to teach
      coupled with a desire to create and share accurate,
      easy-to-read-and-understand documentation on our team's processes, projects,
      and technology stack. He's always available whenever I have questions and
      seems genuinely concerned about whether the things he shares with me make
      sense.  From my experience, Mark is this way with everyone who approaches
      him, regardless of their role or which part of the company they represent.
      Supplementing his professional growth, Mark also makes time to research and
      improve his engineering skills by utilizing his network lab at home.  He
      often shares freely with interested colleagues about what he learns.
      I think the best way to sum up my recommendation about Mark is for me to
      answer the question of “Would I appreciate Mark as my manager?”.  Reflecting
      on this question, I think back to a difficult but important production
      deployment which happened earlier this year.  While no one asked Mark to be
      accountable for the deployment, he was right beside a co-worker who stepped
      up and took responsibility for the outcome.  They both stayed at the office
      past midnight, verifying the deployment was successful.  He's supportive, he
      cares, and he's willing to go the distance by your side to help get the job
      done for the team.  My answer is a clear-cut “Yes”.

      I have had the privilege of working with Mr. Reyes since 2013, when I joined
      Time Warner Cable in the Dallas office.
      At the time, Mr. Reyes was a Network Engineer in Austin and I was assigned
      to work in a “network tools development” group under the same management. We
      collaborated together on several network tools and features. I relied on
      Mark's ability to deftly straddle the world of Software Development and
      Network Engineering, an absolute necessity for developing viable network
      engineering tools.
      In my experience, leadership requires an ability to identify and prioritize
      effort in a way that will produce the best outcome for the company,
      composure and direction under duress, and an ability to adjust communication
      based on audience.  Mark conspicuously demonstrates these three traits, from
      my vantage, in our ongoing professional relationship.
      When our group required a software model for discovering network devices
      that were not readily visible to our tools, Mark stepped-up to help our team
      understand all aspects required to “discover” these thousands of devices so
      they could be recorded in our OSS used to monitor alarms and manage
      configuration, critical for end-customer experience. Mark not only lead us
      in defining and prioritizing this effort, he was critical in the coding
      effort.
      On occasion, when tools issues would spill-over and impact many employees
      across groups ( Operations, Management, Network Engineering ), Mark remained
      calm and lead in identifying root causes and implementing solutions. A calm
      demeanor in stressful times is a leadership quality I cannot overemphasize.
      Mark has this skill.
      Mark enjoys teaching others and he does it well. Anyone in the engineering
      world knows this is not a strong suit among the engineer population. I have
      witnessed Mark give presentations, sit-down with fellow employees and walk
      through complex processes, report detailed status to upper management. He
      adjusts his pace and lexicon to each situation for different personalities
      and audience.
      I unreservedly recommend Mark for a leadership role. He is an engineer's
      engineer who will have respect and trust among whomever he manages.

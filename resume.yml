    As a proud Naval Veteran, I transitioned from four years of dedicated
    service in the Navy as an IT to embark on a successful 14-year journey with
    a major ISP in Austin.

    In my latest role as a Site Reliability Engineer within CIO's Network as a
    Service team, I have shifted my efforts to optimizing operational efficiency
    through automation. With a specialized focus on our team's Security
    Compliance and alignment with CISO guidelines, I am dedicated to driving
    excellence and ensuring seamless operations within the organization.

work:
  - position: Site Reliability Engineer
    name: IBM

    startDate: 2022-03-01
    endDate: 2024-04-12
    summary: |
      As an SRE within CIO's Network as a Service team, my primary
      responsibility revolves around automating manual tasks that reduce human
      time required for complex procedures or deployments.

      In my role as the team's Security Focal, I am dedicated to automating
      Security Compliance requirements outlined by ITSS using the CISO/BISO
      guidelines for Infrastructure Security Requirements. Over the past five
      quarters, I have served as the trusted Technical Owner Delegate for our
      team's Quarterly Security Assessments (formerly MSAC), consistently
      achieving successful outcomes with minimal findings requiring attention.

      For Application Security I designed a Jenkins Pipelines that followed the
      Code Signing Service using Skopeo to publish to Garantir GaraSign.
      Enhancements for automated vulnerability scanning using Twistlock which
      published results to our Artifactory Repo was also used to keep our team
      in compliance with ITSS Ch. 5.

      Implemented a Netbox-Driven Lifecycle for virtual machines, using webhooks
      to automatically generate Jira tickets upon changes in VM's state. This
      seamless workflow will extended into creating AccessHub tickets and
      updating VM's description in vCenter. This workflow is designed to
      systematically track and document a repeatable lifecycle process.

      As a Subject Matter Expert in promoting new feature sets for BlueFringe
      production, I've led over 20 deployments within a Sprint-based release
      framework. By optimizing our procedures, I've transformed the deployment
      process from a multi-day endeavor into a streamlined, repeatable procedure
      completed in just a few hours.
    highlights:
      - Technical Owner Delegate for Quarterly MSACs
      - Automated Code Signing Services for ITSS Ch. 5
      - Image Scanning Automation using Twistlock during build process
      - Defined a repeatable procedure for BlueFringe Deployments

  - position: Manager Network Development
    name: Spectrum Enterprise

    startDate: 2019-04-01
    endDate: 2022-03-01
    summary: |
      During my time as the Manager of a Network Development Team at Spectrum, I
      worked together with a management team to transition a team of twenty
      Network Engineers into Network Developers. This included guiding many into
      unclear territory as their job functions were transitioned. Discovering a
      clear career path and building a collaborative culture were some of the
      small difficulties to overcome.

      Once our Service Reliability Engineering team was estabilished, I guided
      them to continue development of scalable Ansible Playbooks for Automated
      Deployments in our Production Environment; Building automated regression
      tests using GitLab CI/CD and Jenkins; and Containerizing legacy
      applications in Docker.
    highlights:
      - 'Established an environment with three vertical slice teams involving
        over twenty developers and three Area Product Owners'
      - 'Guided my development team to automate a manual process which saved
        Spectrum a projected estimate of one million dollars in Capital Expense'
      - Deployment automations using Ansible Roles allowing a scalable cookbook

    summary: |
      At Spectrum Enterprise, our primary focus was to improve efficiencies of
      our work-order pipeline by means of automating the provisioning of network
      services. We participated in regular code reviews and followed the
      principles outlined in gitflow. Our automated build pipeline(CI/CD) was
      run through jobs executed by GitLab Runners and Jenkins Jobs. Daily
      Stand-ups ensured communication and transparency among the Scrum Team. We
      demonstrated our progress to Stakeholders and Product Owners at a per
      Sprint Iteration. This would allow a project to fail-fast and be agile
      enough to take new direction at the speed of business needs.

      As a secondary hat, I developed scalable playbooks with Ansible roles to
      systematically deploy our network orchestrator. This effort cut down
      countless human hours during our production deployments and regression
      testing.
    highlights:
      - 'Project Lead: Port Activation'
      - 'Testing Lead: Andromeda Project'
      - 'Development Lead: Systematic Deployments with Ansible'
      - 'Application Development: Coffee Reports'

      multiple Networking and Security Certifications from multiple platforms. I
      was able to obtain a CCNP in Routing and Switching, CCNA Security, Juniper
      JNCIA, and Alatel NRS-1.

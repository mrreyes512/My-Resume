  summary: Proud Naval Veteran. Charismatic leader. Habitual learner. After
    four years in the Navy as an IT, I started my 14 year venture with a major ISP
    in Austin, in which I've experienced a tremendous amount of growth. I spent
    four years in field service with Spectrum, and eight years in various Engineering
    roles, with the last position leading a team of Network Developers. As a Manager
    for a Network Development team, it has strengthened my foundation in guiding projects
    which lead toward corporate goals and building a strong development culture which is
    envious to work in.
    Taking the helm of a cross-functional team has allowed me to build trust from
    individuals and inspire greatness by coaching member's strengths, helping them
    contribute to the group's potential. This resulted in establishing a clear
    direction and success in achieving our strategic goals as a
    business unit. I believe my unique blend of Charismatic/Servant leadership
    style is a testament to any team's growth and ultimate successes!

    startDate: 2019-04-01
    endDate: 2021-12-31
    summary: |
      During my time as the Manager of a Network Development Team in Spectrum, I worked
      together with a management team to transition a team of twenty Network Engineers
      into Network Developers. This included guiding many into unclear territory as their
      job functions were transitioned. Discovering a clear career path and building a
      collaborative culture were some of the small difficulties to overcome.
      Once our Service Reliability Engineering team was estabilished, I guided them to
      continue development of scalable Ansible Playbooks for Automated Deployments in our
      Production Environment; Building automated regression tests using GitLab CI/CD and
      Jenkins; and Containerizing legacy applications in Docker.
    highlights:
      - 'Established an environment with three vertical slice teams involving over twenty
            developers and three Area Product Owners'
      - 'Guided my development team to automate a manual process which saved Spectrum a
            projected estimate of one million dollars in Capital Expense'
      - 'Deployment automations using Ansible Roles allowing a scalable cookbook'

    endDate: 2019-04-01
    summary: |
      Our primary focus was to improve efficiencies of our work-order pipeline by means
      of automating the provisioning of network services. We participated in regular code
      reviews and followed the principles outlined in gitflow. Our automated build pipeline(CI/CD)
      was run through jobs executed by GitLab Runners and Jenkins Jobs. Daily Stand-ups
      ensured communication and transparency among the Scrum Team. We demonstrated our
      progress to Stakeholders and Product Owners at a per Sprint Iteration. This would
      allow a project to fail-fast and be agile enough to take new direction at the speed
      of business needs.
      As a secondary hat, I developed scalable playbooks with Ansible roles to systematically
      deploy our network orchestrator. This effort cut down countless houman hours during
      our production deployments and regression testing.

#       Mark is fantastic to work with. He's constantly working on growing his
#       skillset and looking for ways to make work more efficient. His dedication to
#       his job and learning new skills on and off the job is inspirational and
#       admirable. I would highly recommend Mark for any engineering or leadership
#       position.

#     It is my honor to recommend Mark Reyes for a leadership position here at
#     Charter Communications. Mark and I have known each other since 2015 and have
#     worked together directly since early 2018. I have greatly enjoyed out time
#     together and have come to esteem him as a technical authority, but more
#     importantly a mentor. Serving as team lead, he was responsible for
#     organizing the efforts of our team, cultivating new skills in myself and my
#     teammates, conducting internal and cross-group conferences and seeing
#     ambitious goals through to completion. I would be sad to see him go, but
#     understand fully that his many organizational and leadership skills would
#     serve the company far better from a position of management. Without a doubt,
#     I can recommend Mark for a position of more senior leadership. Please feel
#     free to contact me at byron.moore@charter.com if you wish to discuss Mark's
#     qualifications and experience further - I would be happy to expand on my
#     recommendation.

#     I’m very appreciative for an opportunity to recommend Mark Reyes for a
#     Network-Automation/DevOps manager position.  Being assigned for the past
#     year to a group with Mark in a technical lead role, I’ve been more than
#     impressed with his expertise in network development, willingness to share
#     information, and his contributions towards a positive team environment.
#     My current job as a Network Developer is new and challenging.  Mark has been
#     tremendous in helping me to better understand software-defined networking
#     and how our team goes about deploying solutions onto our network
#     infrastructure.  My role within the group is to assist with the automation
#     efforts of our solution workflow and Mark was immense in guiding me through
#     this project.  His help included conducting code reviews, defining a source
#     control strategy of code deployment among various environments involving
#     Git, creating effective templates of Jenkins jobs that I could model to
#     automate deployment, and enabling Webex notifications on the status of these
#     jobs.
#     In working with Mark, what I noticed right away was his ability to teach
#     coupled with a desire to create and share accurate,
#     easy-to-read-and-understand documentation on our team’s processes, projects,
#     and technology stack.  He’s always available whenever I have questions and
#     seems genuinely concerned about whether the things he shares with me make
#     sense.  From my experience, Mark is this way with everyone who approaches
#     him, regardless of their role or which part of the company they represent.
#     Supplementing his professional growth, Mark also makes time to research and
#     improve his engineering skills by utilizing his network lab at home.  He
#     often shares freely with interested colleagues about what he learns.
#     I think the best way to sum up my recommendation about Mark is for me to
#     answer the question of “Would I appreciate Mark as my manager?”.  Reflecting
#     on this question, I think back to a difficult but important production
#     deployment which happened earlier this year.  While no one asked Mark to be
#     accountable for the deployment, he was right beside a co-worker who stepped
#     up and took responsibility for the outcome.  They both stayed at the office
#     past midnight, verifying the deployment was successful.  He’s supportive, he
#     cares, and he’s willing to go the distance by your side to help get the job
#     done for the team.  My answer is a clear-cut “Yes”.

#     I have had the privilege of working with Mr. Reyes since 2013, when I joined
#     Time Warner Cable in the Dallas office.
#     At the time, Mr. Reyes was a Network Engineer in Austin and I was assigned
#     to work in a “network tools development” group under the same management. We
#     collaborated together on several network tools and features. I relied on
#     Mark’s ability to deftly straddle the world of Software Development and
#     Network Engineering, an absolute necessity for developing viable network
#     engineering tools.
#     In my experience, leadership requires an ability to identify and prioritize
#     effort in a way that will produce the best outcome for the company,
#     composure and direction under duress, and an ability to adjust communication
#     based on audience.  Mark conspicuously demonstrates these three traits, from
#     my vantage, in our ongoing professional relationship.
#     When our group required a software model for discovering network devices
#     that were not readily visible to our tools, Mark stepped-up to help our team
#     understand all aspects required to “discover” these thousands of devices so
#     they could be recorded in our OSS used to monitor alarms and manage
#     configuration, critical for end-customer experience. Mark not only lead us
#     in defining and prioritizing this effort, he was critical in the coding
#     effort.
#     On occasion, when tools issues would spill-over and impact many employees
#     across groups ( Operations, Management, Network Engineering ), Mark remained
#     calm and lead in identifying root causes and implementing solutions. A calm
#     demeanor in stressful times is a leadership quality I cannot overemphasize.
#     Mark has this skill.
#     Mark enjoys teaching others and he does it well. Anyone in the engineering
#     world knows this is not a strong suit among the engineer population. I have
#     witnessed Mark give presentations, sit-down with fellow employees and walk
#     through complex processes, report detailed status to upper management. He
#     adjusts his pace and lexicon to each situation for different personalities
#     and audience.
#     I unreservedly recommend Mark for a leadership role. He is an engineer’s
#     engineer who will have respect and trust among whomever he manages.
